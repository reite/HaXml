HaXml
=====

HaXml contains some very useful tools for working with XML in haskell. Unfortunately the current version (1.25.3) does not compile on windows due to some issue with the usage of CPP to expose the version number in the executables.

This package uses cabal instead of CPP to expose the version number.
